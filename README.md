# No AI Slop

A simple site encouraging people to share AI prompts and add original analysis instead of submitting raw AI output.

Generated entirely by Claude for irony

"look at the website nohello.net then generate something similar that admonishes people not to submit AI slop as work products but instead to just share the prompt that they used to generate it."

Inspired by [nohello.net](https://nohello.net)
